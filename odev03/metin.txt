At Phocaea Homer was destined to experience another literary distress.
 One Thestorides, who aimed at the reputation of poetical genius,
 kept Homer in his own house,and allowed him a pittance, on condition
 of the verses of the poet passing in his name. Having collected
 sufficient poetry to be profitable, Thestorides, like some would-be
 literary publishers, neglected the man whose brains he had sucked,
 and left him. At his departure, Homer is said to have observed: 
"O Thestorides, of the many things hidden from the knowledge of man,
 nothing is more unintelligible than the human heart."
